      <h2>Key Insights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          GDP is a driver, but not the sole determinant of HDI. While GDP and HDI are positively correlated, outliers in regions like South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa demonstrate that social policies, governance, and resource efficiency also play critical roles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Regions like SSA face systemic challenges with low GDP and low HDI clustering, while regions like EAP and ECA show greater variance, including high-GDP and high-HDI outliers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Countries with moderate GDP but better HDI outcomes (e.g., Bhutan, Cabo Verde) provide models of effective social investment, highlighting the importance of governance and resource allocation.

      <h2>Strategic Recommendations</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Invest in Social Development Beyond Economic Growth:</strong><br>
          While GDP is positively correlated with HDI, countries with similar GDP levels often have widely varying HDI outcomes.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Policy Focus:</strong> Prioritize investments in education, healthcare, and social welfare to enhance quality of life, even in low- or middle-income economies.</li>
            <li>Learn from success stories like Bhutan (South Asia) and Cabo Verde (Sub-Saharan Africa), where efficient resource allocation has led to relatively high HDI despite modest GDP.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Strengthen Governance and Policy Implementation:</strong><br>
          Countries with moderate GDP but better HDI outcomes demonstrate the importance of strong governance and targeted social policies.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Policy Focus:</strong> Encourage transparent governance systems that prioritize human development indicators alongside economic performance.</li>
            <li>Implement data-driven approaches to track and address development gaps.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
